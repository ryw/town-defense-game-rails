Nexus of Conflict: The Town Defense Game

You start out alone, as level 1 "generalist"

* Determine details of attack wave
- Scout Report: Scouts alert you of some details of an incoming wave of enemies
- Defense setup: you position heros, choose skill/tactics
* Battle (iterates until one side is defeated)
- Results: deaths/stats upgrade/skill acquirement
- Recruiting: you can guide "what you're looking for" but this isn't like hiring mercenaries
- Payment: you get paid for your hard work and effort by the town
- Shopping: traveling merchant offers unique equipment purchase opportunities 
- Training - designate each hero to practice something while the town "waits"
- Training bonus received

Each hero attracts "generic" henchmen of 3 types: warriors, archers, calvary. These shield him from direct damage.

Henchmen that survive battles may "upgrade" to heros themselves.


Hero's are knocked out of current battle, but will be "recruitable" in next games. 2% chance though that he will retire after a knockout.
